## Note for Contributors

As a beginner in coding, this project is a work in progress, and it may take some time before it's fully completed. I'm learning as I go, and I appreciate any support, suggestions, or contributions to help make this app better!

Currently, I am focusing on adding different levels of play for each game. This includes options for playing against AI opponents with varying difficulty levelsâ€”from low to highâ€”that will encourage more strategic thinking. I'm also exploring features that could help teach you the game, making it more accessible for beginners or players unfamiliar with the rules.

Feel free to check out the current state of the game, suggest improvements, or contribute to the development. Thanks for your patience and understanding as I continue to develop this project!
